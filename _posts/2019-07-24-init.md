I cleared the AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner exam today. This marks my  formal entry into the world of Cloud Computing.

With this website, I intend to share my learning journey, experiences and hacks.

There are 3 steps in Cloud certifications - Foundation/Practitioner, Associate and Professional.

Although I talk a lot about Cloud architecture and best practices, I felt a credible validation was lacking to back my words. And I was not confident about directly attempting any Associate level certification with the time I devote for self-learning.

AWS had the Foundational level that gave me the comfort and practice of the exam experience.
